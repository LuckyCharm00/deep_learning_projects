Video captioning, the art of translating a video to generate a meaningful summary of the content, is a challenging task in the field of computer vision and machine learning. Traditional methods of video captioning haven't produced many success stories. However, with the recent boost in artificial intelligence aided by deep learning, video captioning has recently gained a significant amount of attention. The power of convolutional neural networks, along with recurrent neural networks, has made it possible to build end-to-end enterprise-level video-captioning systems.
