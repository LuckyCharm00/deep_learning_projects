# Artificial Intelligence Projects Using Python

This is the code repository for Ariel Chandra's Personal Project on Deep Learning

**9 real-world AI projects leveraging machine learning and deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras**

## What is this project about?
This project will be a perfect companion if you want to build insightful projects using Python.

This project covers the following exciting features: 
* Build an intelligent machine translation system using seq-2-seq neural translation machines
* Create AI applications using GAN and deploy smart mobile apps using TensorFlow
* Translate videos into text using CNN and RNN
* Implement smart AI Chatbots, and integrate and extend them in several domains
* Create smart reinforcement, learning-based applications using Q-Learning


## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chatbot.

The code will look like the following:
```
def get_im_cv2(path,dim=224):
     img = cv2.imread(path)
     resized = cv2.resize(img, (dim,dim), cv2.INTER_LINEAR)
     return resized
```

**Following is what you need for this project:**
This project is intended for software engineers with ML knowledge, data scientists, machine learning professionals, and deep learning practitioners who are ready to extend their knowledge and potential in AI. If you want to build real-life smart systems to play a crucial role in every complex domain, then this project is what you need. Knowledge of Python programming and a familiarity with basic machine learning and deep learning concepts are expected to help you get the most out of the project.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book.
