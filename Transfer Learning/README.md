Machine translation, in simple terms, refers to the translation of text from one language to another using a computer.With the recent advances in recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, such as LSTMs, GRU, and so on, machine translation not only provides an improved quality of translation, but also the complexity of such systems is far less than those of traditional systems.
